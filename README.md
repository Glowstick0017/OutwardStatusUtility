2. When you press F9, the mod collects all effect names from enabled categories- **Enable DOTs** ⚠️ - Bleeding, Burning, Poisoned, Immolate, Plague

3. It searches through all game status effects and matches by `IdentifierName`- **Enable Extreme Negatives** ⚠️⚠️ - DANGEROUS! Petrified, Corruption, Freezing

4. Only effects with matching names are applied to your character- **Enable Food Debuffs** ⚠️ - Starving, Hungry, Parched, Drunk

5. Press NumPad 7 to instantly remove all active status effects- **Enable Diseases** ⚠️ - Infection, Indigestion, Fever, Withdrawal
