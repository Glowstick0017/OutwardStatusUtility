## How It Works

The mod uses **identifier name matching** to apply status effects precisely:

1. You enable categories (e.g., Boons, Combat Buffs) or add custom effect names
2. When you press F9, the mod collects all effect names from enabled categories
3. It searches through all game status effects and matches by `IdentifierName`
4. Only effects with matching names are applied to your character
5. Press NumPad 7 to instantly remove all active status effects

This approach ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Category Filtering** - Only effects from enabled categories are applied
- ‚úÖ **Modded Effect Support** - Works with custom effects by their identifier name
- ‚úÖ **Reliable Matching** - Uses the game's internal naming system
- ‚úÖ **Full Control** - See exactly which effects are applied via debug logs

## Status Effects Database

The mod includes **400+ status effects** organized into 16 categories by their identifier names.
