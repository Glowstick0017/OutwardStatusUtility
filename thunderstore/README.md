## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Negative Effects Can Kill You** - Extreme negatives are disabled by default for a reason!
2. **Effect Stacking** - Applying too many effects may cause performance issues or visual clutter
3. **Imbuements** - Currently no imbue effects in default list (add via custom effects if needed)
4. **Save Your Game** - Before experimenting with negative effects!
5. **Case-Sensitive Names** - Custom effect names must match exactly (e.g., "Rage" not "rage")
6. **Name-Based Matching** - The mod uses identifier names, not numeric IDs, for reliable matching

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens when I press F9:**

- Check your config file - all categories might be disabled
- Enable at least one positive category or add custom effects
- Check logs at `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for errors

**Only some effects applied:**

- This is normal - some effects may not be applicable in certain situations
- Check debug logs to see which effects succeeded/failed
- Some effects are mutually exclusive

**Too many effects applied:**

- Reduce the number of enabled categories
- Use Custom Effects list for precise control

**Game crashes:**

- Disable "Extreme Negatives" category
- Reduce number of simultaneous effects
- Check for mod conflicts

**Custom effect not working:**

- Verify the identifier name is correct and case-sensitive
- Check the [complete effect list](https://github.com/Glowstick0017/OutwardStatusUtility/blob/main/status_identifiers.txt)
- Enable "Custom Effects" toggle in config
- For modded effects, check the mod's documentation for exact names

**Remove key not working:**

- Default is Numpad7 - check if key is bound elsewhere
- Change key in config if needed
- Verify you have active status effects to remove
