---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Nothing happens when I press F9:**
- Check your config file - all categories might be disabled
- Enable at least one positive category or add custom effects
- Check logs at `BepInEx/LogOutput.log` for errors

**Only some effects applied:**
- This is normal - some effects may not be applicable in certain situations
- Check debug logs to see which effects succeeded/failed
- Some effects are mutually exclusive

**Too many effects applied:**
- Reduce the number of enabled categories
- Use Custom Effects list for precise control

**Game crashes:**
- Disable "Extreme Negatives" category
- Reduce number of simultaneous effects
- Check for mod conflicts

**Custom effect not working:**
- Verify the identifier name is correct and case-sensitive
- Check `status_identifiers.txt` included with the mod for exact names
- Check the [complete effect list on GitHub](https://github.com/Glowstick0017/OutwardStatusUtility/blob/main/status_identifiers.txt)
- Enable "Custom Effects" toggle in config
- For modded effects, check the mod's documentation for exact names

**Remove key not working:**
- Default is NumPad 7 - check if key is bound elsewhere
- Change key in config if needed
- Verify you have active status effects to remove
